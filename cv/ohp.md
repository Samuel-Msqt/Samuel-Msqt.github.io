This internship was carried out at the Haute-Provence Observatory, located in the municipality of
Saint-Michel-l’Observatoire. The observatory is particularly known for the discovery of the first
exoplanet in 1995 made with the T193 telescope. During this stay, we primarily used the T120
telescope for imaging and the T152 telescope for spectroscopy.


The goal of this internship was to teach us how to operate telescopes, as well as to process and
analyze the data acquired from these observations. Such as the identification of emission lines, the
calculation of rotational velocity, as well as the understanding of the different structures present
(jets, clouds, etc.).
