### Abstract :

The supply of materials (e.g., sheets, tubes, composite components in stainless steel, zirconium, aluminum) is based on both normative requirements and Oranoâ€™s specific requirements, which are defined in technical specifications and specifications documents for suppliers. Compliance with these requirements is verified through inspections and tests, accompanied by criteria or limit values that the supplier must meet (e.g., tensile tests for mechanical properties, tests for susceptibility to intergranular corrosion, control of neutron-absorbing elements, dimensional checks, etc.).

This scope involves several engineering fields: the prescribing field (in this case, materials engineering), the inspection field (which oversees supplier compliance), the procurement/supply chain field (which completes techno-economic analyses), and the project team. One area of discussion among these parties is the supplier's production capacity. Considering the specified requirements, this capacity can be impacted by non-compliance or deviations from the standards. Analyzing certificates of compliant materials can help clarify production capacity during current orders or for future orders. Currently, these analyses are customized and based on standardized hypothesis testing, among other methods.

The objective of this project is to develop software that facilitates collaboration across these fields and is specifically tailored to meet this need (unlike purely statistical software such as Minitab or JMP).
