## My talk

Presented myself to the LSST France community and presented my work on the Data Preview 1 (DP1) that had been recently released to the scientific community.

I presented my initial progress in characterizing blending in DP1, using Euclid as our truth catalog for the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDFS). The preliminary results show that unrecognized blending rates vary with object magnitude, reaching up to 25% of the dataset at i-magnitude 23.5.
